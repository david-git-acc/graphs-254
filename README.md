This is my work on developing a graph theory visualisation program. 

I have not yet implemented an installation guide or central interface - so far I've been using graph_algorithm.py to coordinate and test everyine as a pseudo-interface.

The goal of this program is to create step-by-step animated visualisations of algorithms covered in my CS254 university course, to act as a revision resource for both myself and for anyone else taking the module.
