# This class will be a wrapper around the Graph class and will be used for building graph algorithm visualisations
# It takes in a set of graphs, which are a dictionary (name - object), and allows you to switch between graphs
# At any given time the graph algorithm will have a "current graph" which is the graph that will be operated on
# if an algorithm is called on the graph algorithm object. 
# 
# When you want to call any graph function, you do so through the graph_algorithm object as a wrapper, passing in
# the reference to the graph you want to apply this graph function to. 
# e.g for a graph G and graph algorithm GA containing G, then: 
# G.add_edge("A","B") becomes GA.add_edge(G,"A","B") 
# it will always follow this format for any graph function - if it previously had n arguments it will now have n+1 arguments
# 
# when you want to run any graph defined algorithm from the algorithms folder, call the self.run_algorithm(alg,graph) method
